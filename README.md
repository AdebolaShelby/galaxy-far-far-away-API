# Requesting a Galaxy Far Far Away

In this activity I created an application that accesses data from the Star Wars API and prints out values from within it.

## Instructions

* Collect the following pieces of information from the Star Wars API.

  * The name of the character

  * The number of films they were in

  * The name of their first starship

* Once the data has been collected, print it out to the console.


* Collect and print out all of the films a character appeared in.
